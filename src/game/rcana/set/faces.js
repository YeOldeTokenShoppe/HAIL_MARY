// R-cana — the PRINTED side of each card: what the face shows that the game
// design does not define. One entry per card in the set.
//
//   id       slug for the face and its art (src/game/rcana/art/<id>.js,
//            public/TCG/rcana/<id>/). Not the design key — "diablito" is the
//            game's name for the card, "el-diablito" the card's own.
//   design   key into designs.js (e.g. "bull") — never the card's name. Type,
//            cost and rules text come from there unless overridden here.
//            The printed name comes from the design too (`printName`).
//   number   the card's lotería number, unique across the set.
//   rarity   Common | Uncommon | Rare | Mythic (RARITY_ORDER).
//   halo / hydro   the two boxes, filled from the design by type: a Trader's
//            Grace and LIQ; an Asset's Prosperity and Liquidity on sale; a
//            called Event's Prosperity. Others print blank. Set them only to
//            override deliberately. Cost prints in the tab automatically.
//   ability  the rules line as printed. Defaults to the design's text, but a
//            printed line is usually shorter than a simulator's. Use \n at
//            a clause boundary to keep triggers and outcomes easy to scan.
//   abilityName  optional override of a Trader's named ability in designs.js.
//                The inherited name sits beside its centered ABIL80 badge.
//   flavor   the character's line (quoted) or narration, below the rules.
//   printed  slots the frame image already prints, so the face leaves blank.

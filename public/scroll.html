          By what measure do we gauge prosperity? Is it the mere accumulation of
          wealth, or the righteous manner in which it is obtained? The faithful
          know: Our Lady of Perpetual Profit watches over those who pursue
          success with both cunning and conscience. Yet, the modern age, much
          like the feudal economies of old, is rife with deception. False
          prophets whisper promises of boundless riches, only to vanish like
          specters in the night, leaving naught but empty ledgers and
          disillusioned believers.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in opposition to such treacheries that
          the RL80 token arises—not as a grift, nor as a mere commodity, but as
          an experiment in ethical economics. It is a sigil of singular80, a
          medallion of prosper80, and a tool for those who seek to wield
          blockchain technology without succumbing to the temptations of fraud.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number 80 is a cipher of both infinity and divinity, a sigil woven into the very fabric of
          both infinity and divinity, a sigil woven into the very fabric of
          RL80. Observe it closely. Turn it upon its side, and it becomes ∞, the
          great ouroboros of endless return, the eternal cycle of creation and
          destruction. But above all, it is the halo, the celestial ring that
          crowns the sainted and the sacred. It is the mark of divine favor, of
          endless potential bound only by the wisdom of its wielder. In ancient reckoning,
          80 was the age of completion, the sign of a journey fulfilled. In the
          hidden numerologies of old mystics, it was a number of
          transformation - a kind of alchemy.</p>

<br/><u>The Annunciation:</u> The
          arrival of RL80 is not heralded with the blaring of trumpets nor the
          frenzied scramble of speculators. No, its birth is one of careful
          deliberation. To guard against the plagues of bots
          and market manipulation, RL80 will first be made available through the RL80 website. 
          This ensures that no singular force may hoard or exploit its nascent
          economy. No pre-sale, no shadowy
          syndicates—only a fair and measured beginning, free from the artifice
          of mercenary whales and algorithmic locusts.

          <u>The Renunciation:</u> But even Our Lady, in her infinite wisdom,
          knows that faith without autonomy is captivity. RL80 is not meant to
          remain cloistered—it is meant to be renounced into the world. Thus,
          when the distribution of RL80 reaches 80,000 wallets of unique holders,
          the token will transcend its initial state, renouncing all taxes.
